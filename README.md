# cpp.currency_converter
A program that initially converts dollars to won and back, but may be expanded to include other currency denominations
In its current state, it needs to be cleaned up a bit and modified with either / or parameters and an array so that when certain denominations are called, they can be brought in with their variables constant and just run the math to output the value to the user
