// Convert Korean Won to US Dollars and Back
//
//
//  Algorithm
//  1. Ask user to select whether they want to convert their won to dollars or their dollars to won by inputing the appropriate choice
//  2. Ask user to input currency value
//  3. Store value in a double variable
//  4. Either divide the value by the ratio of Korean Won to US Dollars and save in a double variable, or multiply the value by the ratio of US Dollars to Korean Won and save in a double variable
//  5. Return the value to the user
